# Overview

Monomer uses the OP stack to make Cosmos SDK applications deployable as
Ethereum rollups.

:::warning
Monomer is pre-production software and should be used with caution.
:::

## At a Glance
From the [OP stack](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/overview.html#components)'s perspective, Monomer replaces the default Ethereum
compatible execution engine. From the [Cosmos application](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/learn/intro/why-app-specific#what-are-application-specific-blockchains)'s perspective,
Monomer replaces the CometBFT consensus layer.
